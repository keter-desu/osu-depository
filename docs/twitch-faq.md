## Why NFv2?

Various reasons combined:

- Can't tolerate getting free 300s on actual 50s/100s (wanna see the *true acc*)
- Have a feeling like this is a more rhythm game way to play as you should aim slider ticks properly
- Slightly believes that it helps to learn tapping sliders
- Much easier to compare scores between each other, especially on stream maps
- NF to never retry and always get scores for future comparison
